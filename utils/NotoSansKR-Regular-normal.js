// This file contains the Base64 encoded data for the Noto Sans KR Regular font.
// It is used by jsPDF to embed the font into the PDF, ensuring that Korean characters are displayed correctly.
// Font source: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans+KR
// The original .ttf file was converted to a Base64 string for embedding.

export const NotoSansKR = `AAEAAAARAQAABAAQRFNJRwAAAAAAAQAAAA... (very long Base64 string) ...AAAAA`; // NOTE: The actual Base64 string is extremely long and has been truncated for brevity. A full version would be required for the app to function. For this exercise, we assume the full string is present.
